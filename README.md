## How far did we get?
Every step of the assignments have been completed, including the non-mandatory steps.

## Additional Notes
Our workflow is to do the primary parts of the code together to ensure we all understand whats going on, and everyone have a chance to comment on the chosen design.
This have an influence on our commits, since only one person is writing at a time it might look like that person is the only one working on the code in that timeframe.
Most of our work sessions have been online, but we did meet up and wrote a big part of the code together.
