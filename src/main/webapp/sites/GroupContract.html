        <p style="width:50%">
            From the beginning we’ve laid some specific ground rules to ensure that every group member has a familiar sense with the code. We have made sure that all eyes at all times were on the coding screen so everyone can be part of the development progress.<br><br>
            We have each day made clear lines as to when we expect to meet, and made sure we completed the days goals and expectations. We have numerous times before been confirmed that for us the reach the highest understanding this shall be the way we do it. <br><br>
            We have valued teamwork highly and have met up whilst coding together as well as sitting in various online meeting rooms to ensure great spirit!<br><br>
